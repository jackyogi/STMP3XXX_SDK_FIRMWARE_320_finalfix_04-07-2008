April 27 2006 (all bitmaps (bmp) files in zip below are now renamed to have filename start with non-numeric initial character)

JLN with work from PD and CL added file: 
\mp3firmware\fonts\src\fontbitmaps\unicode13pixel_1bpp.zip at existing path for SDK 3.120 (and can be used in other SDKs)
since these fonts in said zip were requested by European customers to sigmatel sales. These fonts were used on 36xx (sdk 4.x). 

To learn how to use the fonts in this zip, please download the pdf from https://extranet.sigmatel.com 
titled "Customizing Flash Players" and read the section on fonts. 
Codepages are said by PD to already be in place. 

CL notes: Any of the European code pages will work as well as Code Page 932 which will allow customers to take advantage of the 
Japanese Kanji characters which are also in this font set.
