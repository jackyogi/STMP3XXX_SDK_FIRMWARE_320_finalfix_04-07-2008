The Code Pages in this directory came from the Unicode.org Web site.  
The files were apparently created by Microsoft.

They describe the mappings from characters in different Code Pages to
their Unicode equivalents.  The filename (CP####.txt) indicates which
Code Page is described (e.g. CP932.txt describes Code Page 932).

The character sets covered by some of the Code Pages are listed below:
