MMC Media test Documentation
---------------------------

Functional Description
----------------------
The test verifies the functionality of the MMC Card API and physical hardware. This is done by using all the APIs provided by the MMC module. 
The MMC module supports both MMC and SD cards.

Build Options
-------------
Usage : MMCMediaTest [ALL] DEVICE
     	ALL    = rebuilds all files
	DEVICE = D3410 (required parameter)
	
Test Execution
--------------
The test first runs and tests all the APIs provided by the MMC module.  This includes initializing the MMC card and performing Allocation, etc.
This Single Sector Write test requires less than 1 minute to run.
The complete test requires approximately 7 minutes with a 64MB MMC card, but will vary depending upon media size and latencies.
This test executes within the debugger.  Hitting a breakpoint other than the one labeled SUCCESS at the end, indicates a failure.

Test Architecture
-----------------
The test uses the following library.  Changes to the physical pins required for driving the MMC card can be made in ddiproject.c.
dd_mmc_data_drive.a library
dd_mmc_media.a library
