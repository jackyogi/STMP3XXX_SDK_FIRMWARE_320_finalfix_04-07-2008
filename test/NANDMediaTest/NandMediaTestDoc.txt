NAND Media test Documentation
---------------------------

Functional Description
----------------------
The test verifies the functionality of the NAND API and physical hardware. This is done by using all the APIs provided by the NAND module. 
The NANDMediaTest currently supports both small block (16MB) and large block (128MB) NANDs.

Build Options
-------------
Usage : NANDMediaTest [ALL] DEVICE
     	ALL    = rebuilds all files
	DEVICE = D3410 (required parameter)
	
Test Execution
--------------
The test first runs and tests all the APIs provided by the NAND module.  This includes initializing the NAND, Erasing, Allocating and Discovering the NAND parameters.
The complete test requires approximately 9 minutes with a 1Gb NAND, but will vary depending upon media size and other factors.
This test executes within the debugger.  Hitting a breakpoint other than the one labeled SUCCESS at the end, indicates a failure.

Test Architecture
-----------------
The test uses the following libraries.  Changes to the physical pins required for driving the NAND can be made in cfporthil_project.inc
dd_nand_data_drive.a library
dd_nand_ddi_common.a library
dd_nand_media.a library
dd_nand_system_drive.a library
